            <label>By Sanjay Koripelli</label>
            <p id="newnew">The Fermi Paradox is a fascinating theory that will make you wonder about the universe and what is in it. This famous paradox is named after a physicist known as Enrico Fermi, who wanted to know more about the possibility of extraterrestrial life. This paradox explores the high probability of the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations as well as the lack of evidence for or contact with such civilizations. In simpler terms, it states that if the universe is infinitely big, where are the intelligent aliens? There are many theories on this paradox, but today, we will be exploring seven (7) of them.</p>
